## Objectives of Cardano Ethical Oversight
## 1. Resist Centralized Control  
Cardano governance should serve the community, not a few powerful individuals or organizations. We push back against undue influence, including from the founding entities/individuals.  

## 2. Expose and Prevent Centralization Risks  
We identify and challenge governance structures that allow power to concentrate, whether through vague rules, unchecked financial decisions, or conflicts of interest.  

## 3. Demand Radical Transparency in Treasury Spending  
Treasury funds belong to the community. We advocate for full transparency, accountability, and responsible allocation of funds.  

## 4. Enforce Separation of Powers  
Governance roles must remain independent. We fight to prevent individuals or groups from holding multiple positions that create conflicts of interest.  

## 5. Ensure Long-Term Sustainability  
Governance decisions should protect Cardanoâ€™s decentralization and financial stability for the long run, not just short-term gains.  

## 6. Hold Governance Accountable  
Major decisions should be open, well-documented, and easy to understand. We demand clear justifications and open discussions.  

## 7. Defend Self-Sovereignty  
ADA holders, not centralized entities or custodians, should control governance. We fight for open participation and a system free from corporate or political influence.
