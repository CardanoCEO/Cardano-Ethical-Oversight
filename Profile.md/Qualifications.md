# Qualifications of Cardano Ethical Oversight

We are a coalition of **developers, researchers, business owners, traders, and committed community members** who share a deep belief in **Cardano’s peer-reviewed foundation, inclusive accountability model, and formal methods approach**.

Our group is drawn to Cardano because of its **mathematically sound, scientifically rigorous, and self-sovereign principles**. We believe in **transparent governance, decentralized decision-making, and empowering ADA holders to control their data, assets, and representation in governance**.

## Our Collective Expertise  
- **Seasoned Developers** – Including **former IOG and ex-Indigo Protocol team members** who have built and contributed to critical Cardano infrastructure.  
- **Cryptography and Blockchain Researchers** – A PHD involved in the **design of the Djed protocol**, bringing deep technical knowledge in formal verification and algorithmic stability.  
- **Business Owners and Traders** – Members with experience in **real-world markets, financial systems, and economic modeling** who understand governance beyond theory.  
- **Passionate Community Members** – Long-term Cardano supporters actively contributing to governance discussions, technical improvements, and ecosystem growth.  

We combine **technical expertise, economic insight, and an uncompromising commitment to decentralization**. Our **collective experience** allows us to critically assess governance proposals, identify risks, and advocate for **solutions that strengthen Cardano’s long-term sustainability while resisting centralized influence**.
