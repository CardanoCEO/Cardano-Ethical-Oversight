# Code of Ethics – Cardano Ethical Oversight  

## 1. Decentralization Above All  
We believe that **Cardano must remain decentralized** in both governance and operation. We will actively resist **all attempts to centralize power**, whether by individuals, corporations, or institutions. No single entity should control Cardano’s future.  

## 2. Transparency and Accountability  
Governance decisions must be made **in the open**, with clear **justifications and full transparency**. We will call out **backroom deals, hidden influence, and manipulative tactics** that undermine trust in the governance process.  

## 3. No Gatekeeping in Treasury and Governance  
Cardano’s treasury belongs to the **entire ecosystem**, not a select few. We oppose **bureaucratic control over funding**, including **Intersect’s grip on treasury decisions** and **Catalyst’s biased grant system**. We will fight to ensure that treasury funds are **fairly allocated** based on community needs, not insider influence.  

## 4. Resisting Corrupt Influence  
Founding entities and insiders should **not manipulate governance outcomes** or exert undue influence over ADA holders. We will **hold powerful actors accountable**, ensuring that governance remains free from **manipulation, coercion, or deception**.  

## 5. Ethical Governance and Representation  
We believe **every ADA holder has a voice**. Governance should be **inclusive, free from political favoritism, and structured to empower the Cardano community** rather than centralized entities or venture-backed interests.  

## 6. Self-Sovereignty and Privacy  
We uphold the **core values of the cypherpunk movement**—self-custody, privacy, and open access to financial tools. Governance should never require **KYC, identity verification, or centralized approval**. The rights of ADA holders to **freely participate in governance without oversight or interference** must always be protected.  

## 7. No Conflicts of Interest  
Governance roles—DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee—must remain **separate and independent**. We oppose **individuals or groups holding multiple governance roles** that create conflicts of interest. Cardano’s checks and balances must be **real, not just symbolic**.  

## 8. Fighting Bureaucracy  
Governance should be **simple, efficient, and accessible**. We reject unnecessary layers of bureaucracy that slow down progress and concentrate decision-making power in **unelected, unaccountable institutions**.  

## 9. Exposing Grifters and Unethical Behavior  
We will call out **grifters, dishonest actors, and unethical governance participants** who seek to **exploit the system for personal gain**. Governance should serve the **Cardano ecosystem**, not be a tool for self-enrichment.  

## 10. Long-Term Sustainability Over Short-Term Gains  
Governance decisions should prioritize **Cardano’s long-term health, stability, and decentralization**. We oppose short-term funding grabs, reckless treasury spending, and policies that **weaken the ecosystem over time**.  

## 11. Community First, Always  
Cardano is **not a corporate-owned project**—it belongs to **ADA holders, developers, entrepreneurs, and users** who believe in its mission. We fight for a **Cardano that serves the people, not centralized institutions or private interests**.  

---

We commit to upholding these principles and **holding governance accountable** to them. If we ever **compromise these ethics**, we expect the community to **challenge us, just as we challenge others**.
