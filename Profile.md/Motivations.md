# Motivations of Cardano Ethical Oversight

Cardano governance is at risk of being dominated by **a small group of insiders** rather than the broader community. We formed this coalition to fight for a **truly decentralized, transparent, and ethical governance system**, free from manipulation and undue influence.

## 1. Resisting Centralized Influence  
Founding entities and individuals continue to hold too much power over Cardano’s direction. Their **manipulative tactics, gaslighting of the community, and attempts to steer governance behind closed doors** threaten decentralization. We stand united against **any individual, organization, or institution that seeks to consolidate power** over Cardano’s future.

## 2. Calling Out Unethical Behavior  
Governance should be built on **honesty, transparency, and accountability**. We are committed to **exposing unethical behavior, grifters, and dishonest actors** who seek to exploit the system for personal gain. We will **name and challenge** those who deceive the community or use governance as a tool for self-enrichment.

## 3. Rejecting Grant System Corruption  
Programs like **Catalyst and Intersect’s grant system** act as **gatekeepers**, favoring certain insiders while blocking out independent voices. Treasury funds should be **fairly distributed and free from centralized control**. No small group should decide who gets funding and who doesn’t.

## 4. Opposing Intersect’s Control Over Governance  
Intersect has positioned itself as a **gatekeeper of governance discussions and treasury flows**, contradicting Cardano’s vision of open and decentralized governance. We will not allow **any centralized entity to dictate the future of Cardano** or **restrict access to treasury funds**.

## 5. Fighting Governance Bureaucracy  
Governance should be **efficient and direct**, not buried in unnecessary bureaucracy. We reject **the slow, bloated, and insider-driven governance model** that prioritizes process over real progress.

## 6. Restoring Community Power  
Governance should be driven by **ADA holders, not centralized institutions or private organizations**. Every Cardano holder should have a **real voice in decision-making, without interference from intermediaries or elite gatekeepers**.

## 7. Defending Self-Sovereignty and Privacy  
We uphold the **core principles of the cypherpunk movement**, ensuring that every Cardano user has the right to **self-custody, financial privacy, and governance free from surveillance or control**. We fight for a **future where decentralization is not just a slogan, but a reality**.

We exist because **Cardano’s future must be built on decentralization, ethics, and community-driven governance—not controlled by those who seek to consolidate power**.
